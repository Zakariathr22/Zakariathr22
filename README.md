## Hi, I am Zakaria Tahri 👋

### Welcome to my GitHub profile! 🎉 Here, Let's build, learn, and grow together! 🚀

🔭 I’m currently working on building innovative apps with WinUI 3, including my project [Hakim](https://github.com/Zakariathr22/Hakim), designed for orthopedic doctors to follow up with patients. Also, I’m contributing in open-source project like [WinUI-Gallery](https://github.com/microsoft/WinUI-Gallery).

🌱 I’m currently learning React and advanced concepts in C++.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to healthcare apps, Windows development, or tools that simplify complex workflows.

💬 Ask me about WinUI 3 development, FluentUI design principles, or creating healthcare applications.

😂 Fun fact about me:

I thought CS would be my golden ticket to making money. Turns out, I’ve only been investing in it like a bad startup—every penny I’ve made came from anything but CS. Guess I spent my life mastering an expensive hobby 😂.
> `Despite that`, I couldn’t give up programming because I love it—it's part of who I am ❤️.
