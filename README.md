## Hi, I am Zakaria Tahri üëã

### Welcome to my GitHub profile! üéâ Let's build, learn, and grow together! üöÄ

üî≠ **I‚Äôm currently working on** building innovative apps with WinUI 3, including my project [Hakim](https://github.com/Zakariathr22/Hakim), designed for orthopedic doctors to follow up with patients. Also, I contribute to open-source projects like [WinUI-Gallery](https://github.com/microsoft/WinUI-Gallery).

üå± **I‚Äôm currently learning** React and advanced concepts in C++.

üëØ **I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on** projects related to healthcare apps, Windows development, or tools that simplify complex workflows.

üí¨ **Ask me about** WinUI 3 development, FluentUI design principles, or creating healthcare applications.  

üì´ **How to reach me:** zakotahri@outlook.com

üòÇ **Fun fact about me:** I chose to study CS without knowing what it was! I thought it was all about building computers, but it turns out it's just telling them what to do... and hoping they listen!

> I love programming, it's part of who I am ‚ù§Ô∏è.
