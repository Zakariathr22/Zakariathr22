#### `The person who moves a mountain begins by carrying away small stones.` – Confucius

After years, I realized that nothing in my life really seems exciting to others. The only thing I'm truly good at is sitting in front of a computer, writing lines of code that only a few people might understand. So when I’m with a group where everyone has something to share, I usually stay quiet… because the one thing I find exciting, they probably wouldn’t get. As for everything else? It’s just… less than ordinary.

So if you're reading this, know that this isn't just a GitHub account, this is my home 🖥️💻🧠.

Welcome here 🤝👋.
