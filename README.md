## Hi, I am ZakariaðŸ‘‹

### Welcome to my GitHub profile! ðŸŽ‰ Let's build, learn, and grow together! ðŸš€

ðŸ”­ **Iâ€™m currently working on** building innovative apps with WinUI 3, including my project [Hakim](https://github.com/Zakariathr22/Hakim), designed for orthopedic doctors to follow up with patients. Also, I contribute to open-source projects like [WinUI-Gallery](https://github.com/microsoft/WinUI-Gallery).

ðŸŒ± **Iâ€™m currently learning** React and advanced concepts in C++.

ðŸ‘¯ **Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on** projects related to healthcare apps, Windows development, or tools that simplify complex workflows.

ðŸ’¬ **Ask me about** WinUI 3 development, FluentUI design principles, or creating healthcare applications.  

ðŸ“« **How to reach me:** zakotahri@outlook.com

ðŸ˜‚ **Fun fact about me:** I chose to study CS without knowing what it was! I thought it was all about building computers, but it turns out it's just telling them what to do... and hoping they listen!
