## Hi, I am Zakaria Tahri 👋

### Welcome to my GitHub profile! 🎉 Let's build, learn, and grow together! 🚀

🔭 I’m currently working on building innovative apps with WinUI 3, including my project [Hakim](https://github.com/Zakariathr22/Hakim), designed for orthopedic doctors to follow up with patients. Also, I contribute to open-source projects like [WinUI-Gallery](https://github.com/microsoft/WinUI-Gallery).

🌱 I’m currently learning React and advanced concepts in C++.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to healthcare apps, Windows development, or tools that simplify complex workflows.

💬 Ask me about WinUI 3 development, FluentUI design principles, or creating healthcare applications.
